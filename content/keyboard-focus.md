Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web and need to see where they are. 

## What is Keyboard Focus?

Keyboard focus is the ability to see which interactive element - link, button, form field - you might have moved to with the tab key. 

## Who depends on Keyboard Focus?

Many sighted users with physical disabilities will use the keyboard to navigate a web page, including:
* people with quadraplegia
* people with limited dexterity
* people with tremours such as Parkinson's Disease
* People who might have broken their hand or wrist

People who are blind also navigate the web with the keyboard, but they listen for cues about where they are.
