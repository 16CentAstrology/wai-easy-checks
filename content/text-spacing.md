## At a Glance


## What is Text Spacing?

When users change their text spacing, the content should still be visible and usable.

## Who depends on Text Spacing?

People with low vision, dyslexia, or other print disabilties who need increased space between lines, words, and letters in order to read blocks of text.

## Checking Text Spacing

1. From the content you're checking, select the bookmarklet.
2. Check that it changed the spacing.
   * If not, it fails the requirement to allow users to change spacing.
   * If it changed spacing, check that you can still get to all the content and functionality. Check that:
     * Text is not cut off.
     * Text does not overlap.
