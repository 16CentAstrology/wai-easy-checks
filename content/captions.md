## What are Captions?

Captions are called “subtitles” in some areas.

Captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. They are displayed within the media player and are synchronized with the audio.

Most are “closed captions” that can be hidden or shown by people watching the video. They can be “open captions” that are always displayed and cannot be turned off.

## Who depends on Captions?

People who are Deaf, hard-of-hearing, or otherwise cannot hear the sound depend on captions to provide audio content.

Some people who process written information better than audio information also use captions.

## Checking Captions

Check if captions are available:
* Play the video where there is important audio. If you see captions, they may be open captions.
* Check for a closed caption button in the media player. [image] In some media players, if no captions are available, the button does not appear.
* Click the closed caption button to confirm captions are available in the language of the audio. If it only lists auto-generated captions, then sufficient captions are not provided.

[Automatically-generated captions do not meet user needs or accessibility requirements](/WAI/media/av/captions/#automatic-captions-are-not-sufficient).

Check caption quality:
*  Check if the captions have appropriate punctuation and capitalization. Automatic  captions often don't have any.
*  Check if the captions in sync with the spoken content.
*  If there are multiple people speaking, check if the person speaking is identified when they speak.

_(There are many more aspects of quality captions; above is just a couple.)_

@@ EOWG question: do we want to include the quality checks listed above after "Check caption quality:"? more? less? different ones? none?
