## What are page titles?

Page titles are:
*   shown in the window title bar in some browsers
*   shown in browsers' tabs when there are multiple web pages open
*   shown in search engine results
*   used for browser bookmarks/favorites
*   read by screen readers

## Who depends on good page titles?

People who are blind need good page titles. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.

Good page titles are particularly important for orientation â€” to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser.

## Checking page titles

Bookmark tool: [Page Title ](@@) [(i)]

1. From the web page you're checking, select the "Page Title" tool in your browser bookmarks.
  * Check that there is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of the page.

2. Open other pages on the website and select the "Page Title" tool in your browser bookmarks.
  * Check that the title on the page your are checking is different from other pages on the website, and adequately distinguishes the page from other web pages.

### Tips

*   There is flexibility on what makes a good page title.
*   Best practice is for the important and unique identifying information first (called "front-loading").  
    For example:
    *   Poor titles:
        *   Welcome to home page of Acme Web Solutions, Inc.
        *   Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | About Us
        *   Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | Contact Us
        *   Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | History
    *   Better page titles:
        *   Acme Web Solutions home page
        *   About Acme Web Solutions
        *   Contact Acme Web Solutions
        *   History of Acme Web Solutions
