## What is Zoom Levels?

Zoom levels are used to enlarge the text and images on web pages to make them more readable. In most browsers the 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' & '+' keys will do this for the page content; 'Ctrl' or 'Cmd' & '0' will reset it.

## Who depends on Zoom Levels?

Many people with low vision use the browser zoom to magnify text to become readable. Some people just need to enlarge the text a little if they forgot their reading glasses; others need to enlarge it a lot, e.g. up to 200% or even larger.

## Checking Zoom Levels

Follow the instruction brlow, or try opening the web page on a mobile device as these usually have narrower page widths than laptop or desktop PCs; see 'What to look for' below. 

### Checking this page
This is just for practice. Also, you can see what the check will look like on an accessible page.
* Set the page width to 1024 pixels wide by pressing [[Set Pagewidth]]
* Press 'Ctrl'/'Cmd' & '+' progressivley to enlarage the text to 200%; doing it 5 times should bring you to 200%
* Note that all the text wrapped to remain within the visible area as you zoomed; no horizontal scrolling was required

### Checking other pages 
To check other pages you need to add the check link as a bookmark.

Drag the Set Pagewidth link to your browser bookmarks
1. Visit the page you want to check
2. Click on the ‘Set Pagewidth’ link in your bookmarks to set the page to 1024 pixels wide
3. Press 'Ctrl'/'Cmd' & '+' progressivley to enlarge the text to 200%
   
### What to look for
* Did all the text wrap as you zoomed?
  * We shouldn't see a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the screen requiring us to scroll the page to the right except in unusual circumstances such as a wide table.
* Has any text become hidden behind other page elements and is no longer visible?
  * All text visible on the original page should still be visible on the zoomed page.
