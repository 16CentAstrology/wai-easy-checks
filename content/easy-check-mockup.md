## Home page

The home page provides a shot summary of the resource including an embedded video player with the Easy Checks video.

This is followed by a highlight panel with the heading: "These Easy Checks are not a complete review of accessibility".

Finally the page includes the list of checks under the heading: "[Number] Easy Checks". Each list item includes the check name and a short description and will link to the individual check page.

## Easy check page

This will be a standard WAI page with full navigation. Each check will be included as a linked navigation item hierarchically below the home page, titled 'Easy Checks - A first review'.

The page contains the following structural elements:

* Summary panel with the check name, and short descriptions of the check, the value of the check and what good and bad might look like
* Heading "Checking <subject>" with a description of the check
* Heading "Examples of <subject>" with a good and bad example of the item to check
* Heading "Why is <subject> important?" with a short explanation of who this benefits and how
* Heading "Using a bookmarklet to check for <subject>" with a short description on how to check the issue using a provided bookmarklet. This section also includes a link to the Bookmarklets Help Page
* Heading "Other ways of checking <subject>" with links or information on other ways to check
* Heading "More information on <subject>" with links to resources related to the check or issue
* Navigation to the previous and next check as appropriate
