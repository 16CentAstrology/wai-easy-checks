## What are Transcripts?

_**Basic transcripts**_ are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content.

_**Descriptive transcripts**_ for videos also include visual information needed to understand the content.
For videos with visual and audio information, ideally a descriptive transcript is provided, and a separate basic transcript is not needed.

## Who depends on Transcripts?

People who are Deaf, are hard of hearing, have difficulty processing auditory information, and others use basic transcripts.

People who are both Deaf and blind need descriptive transcripts to get audio and video content. People who process text information better than they process audio and video information also use descriptive transcripts.

## Checking Transcripts

* Check for a transcript with the media or a link to a transcript. Transcripts should be easy to find near the audio/video itself and any links to the audio/video.
* If the video has important visual content, check that it is included in the transcript. (It doesn't need to be labeled as a "descriptive transcript".

@@ EOWG discussion: probably nothing about quality? previous version had: "Check that transcripts include all audio information, including dialogue with the speakers identified, and all important sound â€” e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking." -- yet that seems more than an easy check.
