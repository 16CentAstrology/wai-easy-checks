## ~~At a Glance~~

## What is description of visual information?

Description of visual information is called _audio description_, _video description_, or _described video_ in different areas.

Description explains the visual information needed to understand the video content. For example, “Pat opens a small box, looks at a diamond engagement ring, and cries”.

Description can be provided as:
- **integrated description** — description is included in the main speakers' scripts
- **alternative video** — description is included in a separate video
- **separate file** — description is in a timed text file or synched audio file that is supported by the media player

_Examples:_

* Integrated: [Training video with the description integrated in what the trainer is saying (YouTube)<br>{% include image.html src="/content-images/wai-media-guide/eg-integrated-description.png" alt="" class="normal video" %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUfmCvdzqbM)

## Who depends on description?

People who are blind, some people with low vision, and others who cannot see the video adequately depend on description of visual informatation in videos.

## Checking description

1. Check if description is needed. Are there visual elements that are important to understand what the video is communicating?

2. If it's needed, check if description is provided.
* Is the important visual information included with the main audio, such as the integrated desscription above?
* Is separate described video available? Usually there is a link to a separate described video, or a player control such as "AD(on)" or [image D)))].

### Tips
Generally, all text in the video should be included in the main audio (integrated description) or in the separate description. For example, title text at the beginning of the video, links and e-mail addresses shown at the end, speakers’ names in text, and text in a presentation. The text does not have to be included verbatim (exactly word-for-word), yet all of the information conveyed by the text needs to be available in the main audio, in the separate description, or clearly with the video.
